# University_Club_management

The Club Management System is a web-based application developed to manage university club operations in a structured and efficient manner. The system provides a centralized platform for managing club activities, events, achievements, recruitment processes, and communication between administrators and members. This project was developed as part of a Database Management System (DBMS) course.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly and informative website that enhances the management of university clubs. The system aims to improve communication, simplify administrative tasks, and provide accessible information for students interested in club participation.

## Technologies Used

The system was developed using HTML and CSS for front-end design, PHP for server-side scripting and backend logic, and MySQL for database management. The project was implemented and tested using the XAMPP local development environment.

## System Users

The system supports three types of users: Admin, Club Member, and General Viewer.

The Admin is responsible for managing club information and overall system operations. Administrative functionalities include managing achievements and events, sending public and individual notices, approving recruitment requests, adding new administrators, and updating account credentials.

Club Members can access club-specific information such as achievements, events, and notices. Members are also able to receive personal notices and communicate with the administrator.

General Viewers can explore available clubs, view detailed information about achievements and events, and submit recruitment applications to join a club.

## Database Implementation

The system is integrated with a relational database that stores information related to clubs, members, recruitment applications, notices, achievements, events, and administrator credentials. The database ensures organized data storage, secure management, and efficient retrieval of information.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project locally, install XAMPP and place the project folder inside the htdocs directory. Import the database file into phpMyAdmin. Start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel. Then open a web browser and access the project using the appropriate localhost URL.

## Conclusion

The BUP Club Management System provides a structured and centralized solution for managing university club activities. By integrating database management with a user-friendly interface, the system enhances administrative efficiency, improves communication, and supports student engagement within the university club environment.
